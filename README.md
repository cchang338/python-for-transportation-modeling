# Python for Transportation Modeling

This course provides a basic introduction on the use of Python for
transportation planning and modeling.  It includes a brief review
of the fundamentals of writing code in Python, as well as modules
on tabular data analysis, visualizations, and geographic analysis.
The course assumes that students are already somewhat familiar with
the mathematical tools of transportation modeling in general, and
focuses exclusively on the how these models are constructed and
implemented within Python.


The [first version](http://www.fsutmsonline.net/fdot-python/fdot-python-html/index.html) 
of this course was developed with funding provided by the Florida 
Department of Transportation.
